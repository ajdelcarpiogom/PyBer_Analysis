# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview

The purpose of this code and analysis is in order to create visualizations using rideshare data to help improve access to rideshare services and determine the cost for areas that don't have easy access to this kind of transportation.

### Results

Below we see an image of the data we organized from the csv files given and here we see total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

From this data, we can clearly see that there's a higher population of drivers in urban areas which could be associated with the the population of the people in urban areas as well. This influences the average fares for both drivers and rides because we see the correlation that the average fare tends to be higher when they're in the rural areas versus lower when it's urban. This could be whether places could be closer to one another in urban areas and trips tend to be longer in rural areas, or it could be more common to use the app for rides in urban areas that make this high demand and lower prices versus the rural areas.

This image above also shows that from January 2019 through April-May 2019, the fares were relatively consistent in each area until all slowly increase towards the end of February. It could be that the weather starts getting warmer, encouraging riders to travel and drivers to have more business in their job.

### Summary

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Some recommendations that could be made after analyzing this data could be:
1) Some drivers could be highly discouraged to work in rural areas due to the lower population of riders, which could be easily improved if the fares become more affordable and accessible to those who need it for any situation.
2) Since urban areas have such high demand, there would be no hurt in increasing its fares since these kinds of cities think of this kind of transportation as a necessity.
3) More advertising and discounts/deals could be applied for riders in order to encourage rural and suburban areas to join and partake and better benefits for drivers so the amount of drivers in rural/suburban areas can go up.
